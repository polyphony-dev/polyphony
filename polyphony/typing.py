'''
Like the Python typing module, this library provides type classes for type hinting.
The following type classes are provided.

    - polyphony.typing.bit
    - polyphony.typing.int<n>
    - polyphony.typing.uint<n>
    - polyphony.typing.List[T]
    - polyphony.typing.List[T][C]  â€»C indicates the capacity of the list
    - polyphony.typing.Tuple[T, ...]

The main purpose of polyphony.typing is to specify arbitrary parameters
(bit width, RAM size of the list, etc.) for resources such as register
which is the synthesis result by type hinting for a certain variable.

If you do not specify a type, for example, if it is an int type variable, a default bit width is used.

Type hinting in Polyphony is a feature to generate a resource efficient circuit.
Also, of course, it can be used to detect errors due to type at compile time.
